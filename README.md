# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Trip
### ðŸ›  Naval Architect | CG Engineer | Toolmaker-in-Training

I'm a **Naval Architect** and **CG Engineer** working at the **Marine Safety Center â€“ Small Vessel Branch** in Washington, DC.

### âš“ What Iâ€™m Into
Right now, Iâ€™m building a **VS Code extension** for reading and working with **GHS (General Hydrostatics)** codeâ€”because ship stability deserves better tools. This is part of a broader mission to bridge solid engineering with approachable software. I'm new to coding, but that hasn't stopped me from diving in and making things that actually help.

### ðŸ’¬ A Little More About Me
- ðŸš¤ I work on small vessel stability and structural reviews in the Coast Guard
- â›º Love going outside, camping, my family and pretty boats 
- ðŸŽ“ **University of Michigan** alum â€” *Go Blue! ðŸ’™ðŸ’›*
- ðŸ§  Self-taught coder (in training) 

### ðŸ§° Currently Learning
- Custom syntax highlighting and UI inside VS Code
- Real-world coding with a strong engineering mindset
