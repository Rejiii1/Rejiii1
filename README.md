# 👋 Hey, I'm Trip
### 🛠 Naval Architect | CG Engineer | Toolmaker-in-Training

I'm a **Naval Architect** and **CG Engineer** working at the **Marine Safety Center – Small Vessel Branch** in Washington, DC.

### ⚓ What I’m Into
Right now, I'm merging real-world engineering with better digital tools. I'm building:

- **🔧 [GHS Syntax Toolkit (VS Code Extension)](https://github.com/Rejiii1/ghs-vscode)** — a custom Visual Studio Code extension for working with **GHS (General Hydrostatics)** code. Syntax highlighting, code structure clarity, and a smoother dev experience for hydro geeks like me.
- **🍽 [MealFinderrz](https://github.com/Rejiii1/Weekly-Menu-2)** — a mobile-friendly meal planning and grocery list app designed for actual humans. Drag-and-drop meals, automatic grocery lists, and zero fluff.

- **🛠 [GHS Run File Creator (Tkinter GUI)](https://github.com/Rejiii1/ghs-runfile-gui)** — a multi-tab Python app to generate GHS run files with dynamic forms and tables for weights, tanks, and stability inputs.


These projects are part of a broader mission to build tools that make work (and life) easier, and to learn some coding in the process. 


### 💬 A Little More About Me
